## Git Commit States

1. **Untracked**: A new file added to the directory but not tracked by Git. It appears in `git status` as a red file.
2. **Staged**: A file that has been added using `git add` but not yet committed.
3. **Committed**: A file saved in the repository with `git commit` and assigned a unique commit ID.
